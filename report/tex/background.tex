The Internet Movie Database, commonly known as IMDb is a website with a lot of information about movies, almost like a movie encyclopaedia. It contains almost every movie that has ever been made and lets you browse through details like movie release year, plot summary, actors and actor details, genres, box office collections and much more. Users are prompted to create an account and rate movies between one and ten stars. This is what we consider to be the user rating. It is important to note that the user rating of a title is not just the average of the ratings. IMDb applies filters\cite{IMDbFilters} to the votes to prevent manipulation, which means the rating is more like a weighted average. The box office collection value of a movie is the number of theatre tickets sold times the cost of a ticket. Some websites use it for all sales, for example by including digital sales, but this is not done by IMDb. A movie cast is the actors who act in a given movie. The word comes from the casting processes which is when the director picks actors for the movie. Genre is the theme/type of the movie or the category into which the film is classified into, like drama or comedy. Plot summary is a brief storyline of the movie.
