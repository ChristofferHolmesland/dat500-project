The Internet Movie Database, commonly known as IMDb is a website with a lot of information about movies. It contains almost every movie that has ever been made and lets you look at details like actors, genres, box office and many more. Users are able to create an account and rate movies between one and ten stars. This is what we consider to be the user rating. It is important to note that the user rating of a title is not just the average of the ratings. IMDb applies filters(source: https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/ratings-faq/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV\#calculate) to the votes to prevent manipulation which means the rating is more like a weighted average. The box office value of a movie is the number of theater tickets sold times the cost of a ticket. Some people use it for all sales, for example by including digital sales, but this is not done by IMDb. A movie cast is the actors who act in a given movie. The word comes from the casting processes which is when the director picks actors for the movie.
