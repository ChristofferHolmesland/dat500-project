We believe the search engine presented in this report can be a useful tool for movie directors who are looking for casting inspiration. Even though the top ranked groups contain a lot of actor repetition we believe that the groups in addition to the ranked candidate lists can be used in a meaningful way. We feel that we were able to show the strengths and weaknesses of using Spark by showing the significance of the overhead and how you can optimize an algorithm by utilizing the operations defined on a Spark DataFrame. Next steps could be to find a measure that does not repeat actors as much, or include additional actor features in the search query, like skin color or spoken languages.
