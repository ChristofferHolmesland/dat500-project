We believe the search engine presented in this report can be a useful tool for movie directors who are looking for casting inspiration. Even though the top ranked groups contain a lot of actor repetition, we believe that the groups in addition to the ranked candidate lists can be significantly useful. The use of Spark and MRjob to handle such large amounts of data and processing has proven to be a useful application. We feel that we were able to show the strengths and weaknesses of using Spark by showing the significance of the overhead and how you can optimize an algorithm by utilizing the operations defined on a Spark DataFrame.

Future works could be to find a measure that does not repeat actors as much, or include additional actor features in the search query, like skin color or spoken languages. One could also develop region-based systems for say Hollywood, Bollywood, etc. which would help provide a better insight.
