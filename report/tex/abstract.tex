The abstract describes in concise words what you do, why you do it (not
necessarily in this order), and the main result. The abstract
has to be self-contained and readable for a person in the
general area. We suggest to write the abstract first,
as a means to guide the work, but it should be updated continuously.

In this paper we show how we used data from IMDB(source) to generate a movie cast based on user input. To determine the 
recommended cast we calculate a score based on genres, actor to actor relationship, and a brief movie summary. The user
is presented with a list of actors and the predicted box-office value.
