A system to recommend a movie cast would require reviewing millions of movie titles and thousands of actors along with many other features making it a computationally challenging task. In this project, we have developed a large scale search engine to generate a movie cast using Spark and MRjob. In this report, we have shown how we used the data from IMDB\cite{IMDb} to generate a movie cast based on user input. To determine the recommended cast, we calculate a score based on genres, actor to actor relationships, and a brief movie summary. The user is presented with a ranked list of actors and the predicted IMDB user rating scores.
