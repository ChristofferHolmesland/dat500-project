Our Hadoop cluster consists of one name node and three slave nodes.
The name node has 8 GB RAM and a 2.4 GHz Intel Skylake processor with 4 cores.
The three slave nodes have 4 GB RAM each and a 2.4 GHz Intel Skylake processor with 2 cores.
We used Hadoop version 3.2.1, Spark version 3.0.0-preview2 and Python version 3.5.2.

The Spark documentation recommends using at least 8 GiB memory and between 8-16 cores on each node(source: https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview/hardware-provisioning.html). Because our cluster does not meet those requirements, we had to make some changes to the configuration files. We are running the project as a YARN job and we had to keep in mind that the maximum amount of memory configured in YARN had to be greater than what we configure in Spark. It is not recommended to use more than 75\% of the available memory so we decided on 3 GB. The initial amount of memory Spark uses on startup is defined in the spark.driver.memory. The default value is 1GB which we noticed was a bit too much for our cluster. Instead we used 512MB. The Spark driver only runs if we are running Spark in cluster mode. If Spark runs in client mode, the value specified in spark.yarn.am.memory is used instead so this was set to 512MB as well. The other Spark configuration value we had to set is spark.executor.memory. This is the memory available to each executor on the worker nodes. When deciding on the value it is important to keep in mind that there is a default overhead of 7\%, and that the Java virtual machines also require some memory to run. The minimum value of the 7\% overhead is 384MB(source: https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview/running-on-yarn.html) which means that the value we decide on had to be lower than what 7\% would allow. To be sure that there was enough memory we decided on a spark.executor.memory value of 1512MB.
