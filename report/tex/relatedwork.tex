The IMDB datasets have been used to predict the gross movie revenue\cite{JaeHuang}. The accuracy of several machine learning models were compared to find the best way of predicting the gross revenue. The results show that the random forest model had the best performance and that the most important feature is the number of user votes. The datasets have also been used to compare the user rating with.other features\cite{MaxWoolf}.

In the same analysis they found that lead actors are typically ten years older than lead actresses. The movie project system cinelytic developed by Cinelytic, Inc.\cite{Cinelytic} is able to analyse and produce forecasts of how well a movie will perform based on country, cast and distributor. It also provides useful insights to optimize their content development, financing, production, and distribution decisions. The system ranks actors based on the predicted economic increase they have for a given project. They have partnered with multiple data sources like Netflix, google, the movieDB, Youtube, etc to gather various features relating to a movie.

Our system is similar to cinelytic, but we are basing the score only on IMDB data and use a small subset of the features considered by cinelytic.
