The IMDB datasets have been used to predict the gross movie revenue\cite{JaeHuang}. The accuracy of several machine learning models
were compared to find the best way of predicting the gross revenue. The results show that the random forest model had the best performance
and that the most important feature is the number of user votes. The datasets have also been used to compare the user rating with other
features\cite{MaxWoolf}. In the same analysis they found that lead actors are typically ten years older than lead actresses.

The movie project system cinelytic developed by Cinelytic, Inc.\cite{Cinelytic} is able to analyze and produce forecasts of how well a movie
will perform based on country, cast and distributor. The system ranks actors based on the predicted economic increase they have for
a given project. 

Our system is similar to cinelytic, but we are basing the score only on IMDB data and use a subset of the features considered by cinelytic.
