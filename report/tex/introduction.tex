\paragraph{Context and Motivation}
For a low budget movie it is important to have a well-known actor. It can increase the box office sales or help attract investors (source stephenfollows).
If you are new to the film industry it can be hard to know which actors or actresses will be a good fit for your movie.
It is possible to use previous movies where you liked the performance of the actor as inspiration, but there are too many movies
being made that it is not possible to get a proper overview of all the possibilities. Another possibility is to look at websites like
IMDB (source) to find inspiration. You can use features like the user score of a movie to select actors. We do not consider this
as a good option because there are too many movies to compare, and in practice you will end up looking at only the top rated movies.

\paragraph{Research Problem}
In this report we present a solution to the problem of selecting a movie cast. Our system lets the user input a brief summary of their
movie and a list of actor characteristics they want the lead actors to have. The system uses data from IMDB to rank possible actors
and returns a list of suggestions to the user. The rank is based on a combination of past performance, acting relationships and
a subset of the actor characteristics.
